### ‘Real-time UAV Sound Detection and Analysis’ is a 2017 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS) accepted paper(publication in the proceedings) based on Drone detecting Machine Learning platform.

### Full paper was presented in the 2017 IEEE SAS by the first author & oral presenter Juhyun Kim(drexly), New Jersey, USA, 2017.03.08

* Devised 2 machine learning algoritms and developed 1-Server:6-Clients network interacting UAV air defense GUI system framework by Python which can locate the UAV's appearance by analyzing and machine learning its features (Realtime Fast Fourier transformed Spectogram) through real-time transformed data inputs of UAV frequency from motor sounds
